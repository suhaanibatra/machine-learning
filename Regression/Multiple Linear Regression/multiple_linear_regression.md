### Methods:
1. All in
2. Backward Elimination
3. Forward Selection
4. Bidrectional Elimination
5. Score Comp
   
#### Note:
Backward Elimination is irrelevant in Python, because the Scikit-Learn library automatically takes care of selecting the statistically significant features when training the model to make accurate predictions.
