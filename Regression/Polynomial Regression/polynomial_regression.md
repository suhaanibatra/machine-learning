## Polynomial Regression

#### It is called Polynomial "Linear" Regression because the coefficients are linear and not the dependent variables. 
Here, we first transform the data of single variable X to X, X2, X3 and so on. Then we fit this using Linear Regression model.

### A special case of Multiple Linear Regression.
