## Data Preprocessing
The data we use may be corrupted, and have the following kinds of inconsistencies:
- Missing Data
- Redundant Data
etc.

#### Data cleaning and preprocessing are the first steps in any machine learning process. 

Things to do:
1. Import libraries
2. Import dataset and classify the dataset into dependent and independent variables
3. Taking care of missing data
4. Encoding categorical data (independent and dependent)
5. Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
6. Feature Scaling
